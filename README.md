## Generalization
This Folder contains codes related to generalization of a model that uses MNIST and SVHN datasets. In each file we compare different techniques and their effects on the genralization of the models. This files inculde the Base model, changing model architecture (for example usingg batch normalization, dropuot layers, etc.), different loss functions, using different data augmentation methods and combining them, using different input features, using diiferent optimizers for learning, and also fine tuning the models.
